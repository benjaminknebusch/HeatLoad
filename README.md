## WhatÂ´s about ?

### What is DIN EN 12831 ?

DIN EN 12831 is a European standard that defines the method for calculating the heating load of buildings. 
It is used to determine the required heating power to maintain a desired indoor temperature under 
designed outdoor conditions.

It provides a standardized method to calculate how much heating power (in kW) 
a building needs based on its heat losses, ensuring efficient and correctly sized heating systems.
